Q: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

A: Writing programs with small pieces that all fit into the final product keeps it maintainable, readable, and adaptable. This approach allows you to easily find, fix, change, and reuse pieces of code, because they have their own module and purpose. The CRUD Python module could be used on any Mongo database by just importing it and fixing the authentication.

Q: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A: I start at a high level view when I approach a problem I want to fix. I then work my way down figuring out details in iterations. Finally, I break those details down into easy to manage and fix problems. This project made me include user authentication and database interaction in my thought process of the approach. I would use a module like the CRUD Python module to handle any interaction with the database in future projects. 

Q: What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A: Computer scientists create solutions to problems in the real world with computer software and hardware. These solutions could make menial tasks like data entry and factory work completely automated to let humanity focus on the arts or sciences. They could also help us advance our knowledge of fields of science using software to quickly analyze where a human would have taken years. For a project like this one, the software frees provides an easy way for the business to find the data they need so they can quickly get dogs where they need to go.
